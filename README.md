# Microservice in golang, using Redis and gRPC

**This is the code based on this article :**

https://medium.com/@felipe.infantino.moreno/microservice-in-golang-using-redis-and-grpc-865587aa260c

**Idea:**

This is a microservice that handles basic operations, SET, UPDATE and DELETE using Redis as a database and gRPC as communication architecture. 

**Usage:**

`git clone https://github.com/felipeinfantino/microservice-golang.git`

then 

`docker-compose up`

This is just the server . To test it out use [BloomRPC](https://github.com/uw-labs/bloomrpc)
